<h1>Microservices</h1>

This is the folder that is going to contain all of the microservices. They are ought to be made as 3 separate SpringAPI/Django applications - one application for each microservice. Each of the main methods in them must be mapped to a certain port via a RESTful API endpoint so that the Spring Boot backend can access them.
